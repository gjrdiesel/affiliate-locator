KaxMedia Dev Code Test

We have a shortlist of affiliate contact records in a text file (affiliates.txt) -- one affiliate per line, JSON-encoded. We want to invite any affiliate that lives within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks. Write a program that will read the full list of affiliates and output the name and affiliate ids of matching affiliates (within 100km), sorted by Affiliate ID (ascending).

You can use the first formula from this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) to calculate distance. Don't forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians.

The GPS coordinates for our Dublin office are 53.3340285, -6.2535495.

You can find the affiliate list in this repository called affiliates.txt.

Please donâ€™t forget, your code should be production ready, clean and tested!
